                <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;" >
                    Lions serve. It’s that simple, and it has been since they first began in 1917. Lion clubs are in places
where individuals join together to give their valuable time and effort to improving their communities,
and the world.<br> <br>

<B>Lions Mission -</B>To empower volunteers to serve their communities, meet humanitarian needs, encourage peace and
promote international understanding through Lions clubs.<br><br>

<B>Lions Vision -</B>To be the global leader in community and humanitarian service. <br> <br>

Lions’ history is a long one. And a proud one. For over 100 years, Lions served with uncommon
kindness, putting the needs of their neighbors, communities and world first. Lions look back at their
storied past with pride, but it’s only the beginning. Every day, they’re building on their legacy with the
goal of making an even greater impact in the future. When caring people join together, roll up their
sleeves and take action to make their community better, it’s a beautiful thing and an incredible feeling
for everyone involved. That’s Lions. Being a Lion is about leading by example, building relationships
and improving the world through kindness. It’s 1.4 million caring men and women serving together so
they can make a lasting impact and change more lives.<br>
There are over 48,000 Lions clubs around the world. Each is filled with people like you who’ve decided
to take action and serve others. Lions form unique friendships and meaningful connections that can
last a lifetime.<br>
At the heart of Lions clubs there is one constant: service. Giving your time and energy to others is a
fantastic way to help your community. Yet, it also provides a great feeling for you that can spread and
have a positive impact in your life and how you approach the world.<br> <br>

    <h1 class="mb-0">LEO Club Programme</h1>
</div>

<p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;" > 
    As an integral part of the Lions family, Leos also have their own global network of over 6,500 Leo clubs
in more than 140 nations. This international scope fosters a unique global identity among Leos and
Lions. Leo clubs provide young people with an opportunity for development and contribution both
individually and collectively; as responsible members of the local, national and international
community. <br> <br>  </p>

<h5 class="fw-bold text-primary text-uppercase">History & Objective</h5> <br>

<p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;" > 

    <img src="img/History New.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center" width="600px" height="400px"> <br> <br>

Coach Jim Graver started the Leo ball rolling in 1957 and chances are that ball was a baseball. Graver
was the baseball coach of the Abington High School in Pennsylvania, USA and an active member of the
Glenside Lions club. With help from his fellow Lion, William Ernst, the first Leo club was charted on
December 5, 1957.<br><br>
As the world’s first Leo club, the Abington High School Leo club was created. The LEO acronym was
defined as Leadership, Equality, Opportunity and their school colours; maroon and gold were chosen
to serve as the Leo club colours. Later, Equality was changed to Experience. In October 1967, the board
of directors of Lions Clubs International adopted the Leo Club Program as an official program of the
association. The Leo Club Program has been growing strong for over 50 years in Sri Lanka. Community
service remains the cornerstone of the program. Like their Lion counterparts, Leo club members enjoy
serving their neighbours and watching positive results unfold.<br><br>
In 1969 the first ever Leo club was inaugurated in Sri Lanka; Leo club of Wattala. The program became
popular among Lions, which then paved way for many more Leo clubs. In order to better fulfill both
administrative and service requirements, District 306 was divided in 1978 to two districts; namely
306A and 306B.<br><br>
With this division, Sri Lanka’s multiple district 306 was born. Under the new structure, the two sub
districts 306A and 306B were able to serve more effectively. With the passage of time, districts 306A
and 306B expanded their network steadily. For administrative purposes, the need for redistricting was

once again necessary and in 1998 the multiple district 306 was re-demarcated to three sub districts;
306A, 306B & 306C.<br>
Due to the rapid growth of Leoism, once again in the year 2004/2005 another redistricting program
was carried out re-demarcating to 6 Sub Districts; 306A1, 306A2, 306B1, 306B2, 306C1 & 306C2.
However, Leos have conducted and will continue conducting various activities to the needy children
and elders, furthermore the environment and healthcare as well as the betterment of the Leo
movement and its members. </p> <br>


<h5 class="fw-bold text-primary text-uppercase">Motto & Logo</h5> <br>
<p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;" > 
    The Leo club motto leadership, experience, opportunity says it all: <br> 

    <img src="img/Leo Emblem.png" alt="Paris" class="center" width="400px" height="400px"> <br> <br>

<b>LEADERSHIP - </b>

Leo members acquire skills as project organizers and motivators of their peers.<br> <br>

<b>EXPERIENCE - </b>

they discover how teamwork and cooperation can bring about change in their community and the

world. <br> <br>

<b>OPPORTUNITY - </b>

Leos develop positive character traits and receive recognition for their contributions. <br> <br></p>

<p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;" >
    Whether based in the community or a school, Leo clubs provide members with the camaraderie and
growth that come from participation in community service projects, social functions and leadership
development activities. <br> <br>

<b>Community Based Leo Clubs</b> offer membership to any eligible young person within the local area of
the Leo club. These clubs meet at a suitable location in the community, and a member of the
sponsoring Lions club serves as the Leo club advisor. <br> <br>
<b>School Based Leo Clubs</b> draw on members from a school. These clubs often require the appointment
of a faculty advisor usually a teacher, counselor or school administrator to act as a liaison between
the school and the Leo club. The faculty advisor also assists the Leo club advisor, who is a member of
the sponsoring Lions club. The school must agree to fulfill Leo club program responsibilities and the
Leo club must agree to follow the policies, insurance requirements and regulations of the school. The
Leo club is subject to the same rules established by the school authorities for all student organizations
and extracurricular activities. Before the Leo club is organized, the Lions club and school should agree
on procedures for organizing club activities on and off school property, which adhere to school policies
and LCI board policy. <br> <br>
Leo clubs are also divided into two tracks: <b>Alpha and Omega</b>. <br><br>
<b>Alpha Leo Clubs</b> are designed for youth between 12 and 18 years of age. This track focuses on the
individual and social development of teens and preteens. <br> <br>
<b>Omega Leo Clubs</b> are tailored for young adults between 18 and 30 years of age. This track is designed
for the personal and professional development of young adults.

    <h1 class="mb-0">Origin Of Leoism in Sri Lanka</h1>
</div>

<p class="mb-4" style="text-align: justify;" >

    In 1969, the first-ever Leo Club was inaugurated in Sri Lanka, the Leo Club of Wattala, comprising of a team of cricketers. This program became popular among Lions, after which they paved the way for many youths by launching more Leo Clubs. In 1978, the Lions Multiple had sufficient Leo Clubs to have Sub-Districts. The main reason behind the redistricting of the Leo Multiple was to ease administrative activities.
<br> <br>
The Multiple 306 was divided into 306 A and 306 B. In 1989, the Sub-District 306 C was established through the combination of certain parts of 306 A and 306 B. The redistricting took place again in 2005 as the Multiple 306 was divided into 6 Districts A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. The Divisional Presidents of each District aimed at increasing their Leo member count while ensuring quality over quantity.
<br> <br>
At present, over 200 Leo Clubs are located islands wide including Colombo, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Down-South, actively serving the community, with leading school and university Leo Clubs among them.
